          <h3>League Overview</h3>
          <p>The National Football League (NFL) is the highest level of professional football in the United States. It is structured into two conferences—the AFC and NFC—each divided into four divisions. With 32 teams, the league runs a 17-game regular season followed by a 14-team playoff format that culminates in the Super Bowl, one of the most watched sporting events in the world.</p>
          
          <p>What makes the NFL distinct from college football are not only the athletes and resources, but also several key rule differences. The NFL's hash marks are positioned closer together, creating a narrower field that changes kicking angles and offensive strategy. The two-minute warning is a professional-only clock stoppage that increases end-of-half drama, while the overtime system has its own modified sudden death rules. These details create a game that is often faster, more precise, and more strategically complex than its college counterpart.</p>

          <h3>Key Rule Differences</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Overtime:</strong> Regular season uses modified sudden death; postseason ensures both teams get possession if the first team scores only a field goal.</li>
            <li><strong>Hash Marks:</strong> Positioned closer together than college, making kicks easier and limiting field-side space.</li>
            <li><strong>Play Clock:</strong> 40 seconds between plays (vs. 25/40 in college).</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Minute Warning:</strong> Unique to the NFL, automatic stoppage near the end of each half.</li>

          <h3>Professional Culture &amp; Identity</h3>
          <p>Beyond the field, the NFL represents a cultural phenomenon. Professional franchises are billion-dollar organizations that shape local identities and dominate national television broadcasts. The league's global reach is seen through merchandise sales, international games in London and Germany, and the worldwide spectacle of the Super Bowl.</p>
          
          <p>The NFL is a business as well as a sport—media rights, merchandise, fantasy leagues, and sports betting create a global reach. Stadiums are designed for massive audiences, sponsorships, and broadcast technology. The Super Bowl is not just a game—it's a cultural event, with halftime shows and commercials as iconic as the game itself.</p>
