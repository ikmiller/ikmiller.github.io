          <h3>College Football Overview</h3>
          <p>College football is organized under the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) with over 130 Division I FBS (Football Bowl Subdivision) teams competing across multiple conferences. The season runs from late August through early January, culminating in the College Football Playoff that determines the national champion.</p>
          
          <p>What makes college football distinct from the NFL are the wider hash marks that create more dramatic field angles, longer overtime periods that emphasize scoring, and the amateur status of players who compete for scholarships rather than salaries. The college game features more diverse offensive schemes, from triple-option attacks to high-tempo spread offenses, creating a more varied and unpredictable style of play.</p>

          <h3>Key Rule Differences</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Overtime:</strong> Teams alternate possessions from the 25-yard line; each team gets a chance to score in every overtime period.</li>
            <li><strong>Hash Marks:</strong> Positioned wider than the NFL, creating more extreme field angles and strategic considerations.</li>
            <li><strong>Play Clock:</strong> 25 seconds after referee signals ready-for-play, 40 seconds after timeouts and changes of possession.</li>
            <li><strong>Clock Management:</strong> Clock stops on first downs until chains are set; more clock stoppages than NFL.</li>

          <h3>College Football Culture &amp; Traditions</h3>
          <p>College football is deeply rooted in campus life and regional traditions. Massive stadiums like Michigan's "Big House" and Alabama's Bryant-Denny Stadium regularly host over 100,000 fans. Game day is a cultural event that spans entire weekends, with tailgating, marching bands, and century-old rivalries that define college towns across America.</p>
          
          <p>The amateur nature of college football creates unique dynamics around recruiting, scholarships, and the transfer portal. Players compete for their schools while pursuing degrees, creating storylines that blend athletics with academics. Bowl games, conference championships, and rivalry trophies carry deep historical significance that often transcends individual seasons.</p>
